      <div class="userContainer">
        <br> The first time I attempted suicide, I was a junior in high school. It was around the time of college applications.
        Everyone’s like, “We need to figure out our future.” I was like, “Oh, god. I can’t do that. I have no idea.” Plus,
        I’d been depressed for a few years, starting in middle school, so it was that and the uncertainty of leaving high
        school. I had no idea what I was doing, but apparently I should have known at that point, which is a terrible thing
        to tell teenagers.
        <br>
        <br>I was at a school that was pretty high-achieving, so I was surrounded by people that were really on-track. They
        had their shit together. They knew what they were doing, and I was floundering. I thought I was supposed to be one
        of these put-together people, but I couldn’t quite do it. Eventually I got way too overwhelmed. I was like, “I can’t.
        I can’t do it. I just can’t deal with this.”
        <br>
        <br>Going to school was so terrible. I’d wake up every morning and go, “Goddammit. I have to do this again.” It was
        painful going through the motions.
        <br>
        <br>One night, I was home alone. I lived with my mom at the time, but she was out. I overdosed on pills I found around
        the house. Shortly after I took them, I thought, “Maybe this was not a good idea.” I called a friend. She came over
        and called the ambulance. I was taken to the hospital, and I voluntarily went into a psych ward. I was only there
        a few days because I was a minor at the time. Pretty much whatever my parents said went.
        <br>
        <br>After a couple of days, my mom was like, “Yeah, I think you’re good now.”
        <br>
        <br>I was like, “Alright, let’s bounce, I guess.”
        <br>
        <br>My time in there wasn’t really helpful. I expected people, in general, to be really judgmental because there’s
        still such a strong stigma, but I didn’t expect medical professionals to be that judgmental. The mental health techs
        were really nice. They interacted with patients all the time; they knew what was what. When I talked to psychiatrists,
        they would be like, “Oh, you know, what you did was really serious. You really worried your parents.”
        <br>
        <br>I was like, “I know. I’m sorry. That’s not what I meant to do. I’m just a teenager, my brain is not good yet.”
        <br>
        <br>I was put on medication. They didn’t really talk too much about it. [They just said], “It’s an SSRI. This is
        how it works. Take it every day. You’ll start feeling better in a couple weeks.”
        <br>
        <br>At some point, I stopped taking them cold turkey. They always say not to do that, ever—it’s terrible—but I did,
        and I felt horrible. I thought, “I don’t really need these pills anymore. I’m feeling better,” so I stopped taking
        them, which was probably a bad idea. It was definitely a bad idea without consulting someone.
        <br>
        <br>Then, I was alright. I was pretty stable for the next couple years, living at home, and going to community college,
        trying to transfer out. I really wanted to leave home and go anywhere but California. Maybe three years later, I
        transferred to upstate New York to go to school. It was not a good idea. I didn’t know anyone in New York.
        <br>
        <br>It was about two hours out of the city—a really small place. The only person I knew lived about five hours away
        from me. All my friends were back in California and I don’t make new friends easily. I got along well with my housemates,
        but other than that, I didn’t really have any friends. There wasn’t much social support.
        <br>
        <br>Part of my deteriorating mental state at that time was [due] to taking really early classes. They were at 7 AM,
        so I had to wake up around 6. It sounds kind of dumb—it’s just waking up early—but I get super crazy when I don’t
        get enough sleep, so I’d stay up really late because I wasn’t thinking of consequences. Then I’d wake up at 6 AM
        and drudge through the freezing cold into class every day. On top of that, I still didn’t really know what I was
        doing. I was technically majoring in theater at the time, but I didn’t really want to. I was thinking maybe English,
        but I couldn’t decide.
        <br>
        <br>So, I was up here, super far from everyone, doing something I wasn’t sure I wanted to do. I felt really bad because
        my parents were paying for it, and it was really expensive, especially because I was out-of-state. I got super inside-my-head
        again. I actually did go talk to a therapist at the school and got medication, but I, again, stopped taking them.
        I’d miss some doses, [realize it], catch up, and then I’d forget again. I was not consistent, which I think is important
        to taking medication.
        <br>
        <br>That was messing around with my brain. Everything was not good in my head. I didn’t know how to deal with these
        feelings. I hadn’t dealt with them the first time I attempted. They were coming back, and I [didn’t understand] why
        I was still feeling like that.
        <br>
        <br>I attempted suicide again near the end of the quarter. One of my roommates was home at the time, and she took
        me to the hospital. This time, I was involuntarily committed to the psych ward, which was not fun. My psychologist
        scared me. I didn’t like talking to him. He put me on a bunch of medications—maybe three or four.
        <br>
        <br>I was there for about two weeks. The first few days were really freaking horrible. I didn’t know what was going
        on. I didn’t know the routines. There were people telling me what to do all the time. It was a strange experience.
        <br>
        <br>After the initial adjustment period, it was actually kind of a relief to be there. It’s not like anyone in there
        was going to judge me. Everyone was in there for a reason, and it felt nice to not have to put on the appearance
        that I was I fine. I could be super sad or… just be myself, I guess. Whatever I was at the time.
        <br>
        <br>After I got out, I moved back to California. I didn’t really want to stay at home or deal with living with my
        mom again so, shortly after that, I moved to Georgia to stay with one of my friends. I thought this was definitely
        a good idea. It would be a new start, in a new place, with new scenery. This time I’d have friends—one of my friends
        from California came with me. It was the three of us and a couple more people living in an apartment, and I thought
        it would be great.
        <br>
        <br>It was alright for a while, and then I realized… living with friends is not necessarily the best idea. I love
        my friends to death. We’re still really close, but we did not live well together. Maybe if I’d been in a better place,
        then it might have been okay. We had a ton of freedom; we all worked part-time jobs, a couple hours a week. Other
        than that, we could do pretty much whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted. Stay up till 4, sleep in till 4.
        <br>
        <br>That was not helpful at the time, not at all. There were people coming in and out all the time. There were lots
        of drugs—mostly weed. I was not into it at all. I reacted to that by being a horrible, horrible roommate. I was super
        passive-aggressive and picked fights all the time. I made everything super toxic for everyone who lived there, which
        made it worse for myself.
        <br>
        <br>At this point, I was really angry that I couldn’t get out of this funk. I didn’t understand why I felt so bad
        all the time. Even back in middle school, when I first was diagnosed with depression, I didn’t know why. They don’t
        really talk about it a lot in school, which is where I got most of my information. What I knew about mental illness
        was from movies, TV, books… and it seemed like, in those cases, there was always a catalyst or something that happened
        in their lives that derailed them—a reason why they’re depressed. I didn’t have that. I had a really good childhood.
        There was no big trauma, nothing like that. So I thought, “Why am I feeling like this? There’s no reason. It’s not
        legitimate. There must be something wrong with me to feel this way.”
        <br>
        <br>I felt like that for a long time. When I was in Georgia, I was like, “Why do I still feel like this? I need to
        just get over it or something.” I didn’t go see anyone. I think, when I moved there, I still had medication leftover
        from when I was prescribed them in New York. When I ran out, I honestly didn’t know how to get more or where to find
        a new psychologist. It was so daunting and I had no motivation to do it. I stopped cold turkey again, which is way
        worse when you’re on a lot of medication.
        <br>
        <br>I was going through the withdrawal type things, which were awful. I was working a part-time job at a restaurant
        nearby, and I hated it. I don’t really like talking to strangers a lot. It was so much interaction constantly. People
        were always getting mad at me for stupid things I had no control over. I’m like, “I don’t actually cook the meals.
        I just bring them to you and then take them away.” [It’s a high-pressure job], and I just couldn’t do it. I’d only
        been there for a month or two, but I hated it. I hated living with my friends, and I hated everything about the situation.
        <br>
        <br>One night, I was sulking in the room alone and thinking, “I have to get up early tomorrow for work. I really
        don’t want to go to work. It’s terrible.” Then I got this thought in my head, “Well, I still have [medication] left.
        If I take all of those and don’t wake up, I won’t have to go to work. I won’t have to deal with work or my friends
        or any of this.” It wasn’t a logical thought at all, but it had lodged itself into my mind like, “No work tomorrow.
        You don’t have to do it. Just take the pills, and that will solve everything.” I was like, “Yeah, I’ll just do that.”
        <br>
        <br>The other two times I attempted, after I’d taken the pills, I realized it was a bad idea and I shouldn’t have
        done that. This third time, the most recent time, I honestly didn’t care. I didn’t tell anyone. My friends were all
        outside sleeping or doing whatever. I didn’t want to stop it. I wasn’t sure if I was going to wake up or not, but
        if I didn’t… cool.
        <br>
        <br>I went to bed, and woke up maybe a couple hours later. I was super sick for the rest of the night. In the morning,
        one of my friends found me passed out in the bathroom—so much puke everywhere. They had to call an ambulance.
        <br>
        <br>I was involuntarily committed again, but this time was really scary because my friends didn’t know where I was.
        I didn’t know how to get in contact with anyone. Apparently, once they moved me from the ER to the psych floor, they
        weren’t allowed to tell anyone I was there, unless it was my family or something. I didn’t realize that, so I was
        there for a couple days like, “Oh my god. Why aren’t my friends contacting me? I don’t have any of my stuff.” I was
        in a hospital gown that was three sizes too big, so I wrapped it around myself and shuffled through the halls like,
        “Where is everyone? I don’t know where I am, exactly. I don't know how long I have to be here. I really want to see
        someone familiar.”
        <br>
        <br>That was really scary, but eventually I did get in contact with my friends. I was there for about two weeks.
        I got out, and that was the last time. That was nine years ago.
        <br>
        <br>I’ve been doing a lot better. I wish I could say it was because I went to therapy and I started taking medication
        regularly like an adult. But I didn’t. I probably should have. I think my brain chemistry maybe settled down because
        I got older and into a more stable pattern of living. I wasn’t moving around constantly. I got a job. I started going
        to school. Sometimes I still feel little glimpses of how I felt back then. It’s terrifying, but generally those don’t
        last long.

            <br>Kate MacHugh is now 25. She’s an author and clinician.
            <br>
            <br>But she only got to where she is now by overcoming depression as a teenager.
            <br>
            <br>MacHugh said she was “harassed, humiliated and cyberbullied,” during her teenage years, leading her to go
            from being a happy and vibrant youngster to someone more angry and “sullen.” Once she became a different person,
            she slowly slipped into the murky waters of depression.
            <br>
            <br>“It was the lowest I have ever felt in my life," she said to the National.
            <br>
            <br>But everything changed once she went to college. The peers who had put her down and bullied her within the
            walls of high school were long gone, and she could finally start focusing on what made her unique and special.
            Instilling confidence in herself was what got her past depression and on a path to success, she said.
            <br>
            <br>“I worked really hard to change the messages in my head,” MacHugh said. “I was led to believe that I was
            ugly, worthless, and disgusting. I internalized these messages and they became part of my identity. I began to
            tell myself that I was smart, loved and beautiful."

            <br> My faith? My faith is interesting. I grew up in the church, but I grew up in the Episcopalian church, which
            is like diet Catholic.
            <br> We're like, "Ehh! We're gonna say some nice and great stuff and here's a wafer, but you know, you can
            
            <br> get divorced, and gay people are cool." That's my kinda church.
            <br>

            <br>  I grew up in a very open, lovely church, but I had difficulties with my relationship with God because I just
            didn't understand how I could be so sad, and when would it stop? 
            <br>I attempted more than once, but the huge one when I was 25. <br>
            <br> When I was 25, I made a promise to God before I attempted and I said, "If this doesn't work, I'm never doing this again." I really meant
            it because
            <br> I felt like I needed to do something else. I had lost a friend who had died in an accident, and again,
            
            
            <br>  I had a similar feeling of feeling guilty that I was going to attempt and that he wasn't here, and wanting to
            trade places like,
            <br>
            <br>  "I would happily give my life, 'cause you deserve life, 'cause you want it. You're thirsty
            for it,and I question if I want it."
            <br>
            <br>   The day that I attempted, I took this lavender rose that he had given to a
            friend, and my friend gave it to me, so I had it from him.
            <br>  When I woke up the next day, after surviving, it was
            gone.
            <br> I don't know, I felt this presence, like, 
            <br>
            <br>  "Yeah, you're not supposed to leave. You woke up. You woke up and you made a promise and you're gonna try to do everything to figure out why you don't want to be here,and also figure out a way to stay."
           <br>
             <br>  My spirituality is checking in with God and saying, "Oh, things are bad," and remembering that time when my hope was so small and so quiet.
            <br>  It was like Pandora's Box: all these other things are
            coming out,
            <br>  like lies, viciousness, anger, and hope is super tiny and this little white butterfly. 
           
            <br>Over the years, it's grown, and it's a larger voice in my head than the other ones that are saying,<br> "You shouldn't be here."
           <br>
            <br> The voice of hope is like,
            <br> "You have survived all these other things and it's reasonable.”
            <br> It's like,<br> 
            "Do you really wanna go? Maybe just keep trying and all of the good things you're doing will catch up with you and you'll feel
            better."
            
            <br> 
            <br> That, to me, is spirituality. It's when I'm out in the wilderness and I feel calm, and when I'm in the Redwoods
            <br> and I just feel this sense of safety. It's my favorite place to be. It’s so quiet, and I just can breathe
            and
            <br> have conversations. It doesn't happen in a church. It happens on my way driving with no music. It's just
            a conversation,
            <br> but that's one of the many things that has been keeping me well. And sane. My version of sane. Gotta be
            interesting.

            <br>I’m a human rights activist, first and foremost. Everything that I’ve done since I was a kid, in terms of
            what’s been important to me, has been activism–whether it’s for Muslims or it’s for Iranians or LGBT rights or
            for people who are mentally ill.
            <br>
            <br>The thing about the mentally ill is [that] I had never been familiar with that community until I was diagnosed
            and went into the hospital and realized that this is an incredibly vulnerable community that is so silent and
            is not some tiny minority of people. You’re talking 25 percent of the population in a given year. 50 percent
            of people in their lifetime will have a mental illness. It’s not some tiny minority of people, but they’re so
            fucking quiet about it, and that was the thing that really pissed me off when I went into the hospital and realized
            that.
            <br>
            <br>One of the stories that I think is really indicative is, I was in a hospital in Ohio and it was... 2008 was
            the election, and so I was very excited. Everybody had this Obama mania, and I was manic. At the time, I thought
            I was a high-level advisor to President Obama, so I was very excited for him to win. Anyway, there was a gentleman
            on the floor who had been a Vietnam vet–I had already voted early, so it wasn’t an issue for me–but he was a
            vet and he asked to vote, and one of the nurses laughed at him. You can’t do that. That’s illegal. You can’t
            take someone’s right to vote away because they have a mental illness or because they’re hospitalized.
            <br>
            <br>Witnessing something like that, knowing that what she was doing was illegal–and then, on top of it, the humiliation
            of laughing at somebody who’d served his country and part of the reason he was there was because of what he’d
            gone through–it really pissed me off. It made me realize that we don’t get a vote in so much. That’s just one
            example, and it happens to a lot of people...
            <br>
            <br>I’ve never seen that kind of discrimination plus humiliation. The thing about stigma is there’s general societal
            stigma and then there’s the stigma within the mental health community, [which] is a lot worse, in my experience.
            You would think it wouldn’t be. There was a study in the UK awhile back about how, over time, societal stigma
            has gotten better, but within the mental health community it’s stayed the same roughly–pretty much the same–over
            I don’t know how many years, but that’s my experience. I’ve experienced a lot more discrimination [from medical
            professionals]. Can you imagine laughing at somebody who says they want to vote? It’s their most basic civil
            right. I think, in a way, they become immune and, in a way, they feel like they have to protect themselves, but
            at the same time it’s just really dehumanizing.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>If you’re feeling suicidal, please talk to somebody. You can reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
            at 1-800-273-8255.
